                Part I: The Immediate Loss (The Online Purchase)
              </h4>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                When Anjali clicked "confirm order" on the massive online
                clothing site, she felt a small thrill. A new dress, arriving in
                two days. Total spent: ₹3000.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                That ₹3000 traveled instantly across the country, perhaps across
                an ocean, straight into the account of a colossal corporation.
                The money paid for warehouse automation, an executive salary far
                away, and global marketing. It was efficient, fast, and
                convenient.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                But that money, swift as it was, was gone from her town forever.
                It skipped her community entirely, leaving nothing behind but a
                box on her doorstep and a faint feeling of economic emptiness.

                Part II: The Continuous Ripple (The Local Purchase)
              </h4>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Now, imagine the alternative. Anjali walks down Main Street and
                buys the same dress from Diya's Boutique. The cost is the same:
                ₹3000.
              </p>
            </div>

                The First Ripple: Security
              </h4>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Diya takes that ₹3000. It's not just a number; it's a certainty.
                That evening, she walks to The Daily Grocer and spends ₹2000 of
                it, ensuring her family has fresh food for the week.
              </p>
            </div>

                The Second Ripple: Education
              </h4>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The Grocer, Mr. Hyder Ali, now has Diya's ₹2000. He was just
                worrying about his daughter's worn school clothes. He takes ₹600
                and walks to Mr. Satheeshan, the Local Tailor, to have her
                uniform mended and fit perfectly. Mr. Hyder Ali is proud his
                daughter will look sharp for school.

                The Third Ripple: Health & Sustenance
              </h4>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Mr. Satheeshan, the Tailor, feels relieved. He takes that ₹600
                and immediately spends ₹200 at the farmers' market stall run by
                Ammachi (Old Mother), buying crisp carrots and onion. He thinks
                of his family's dinner.

                The Logical Conclusion
              </h4>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The story doesn't end there. Ammachi will use her ₹200 to buy
                more produce. It will go to another farmer, another worker,
                another family. That first ₹3000 hasn't left the community; it
                has multiplied.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                It bought a dress for Anjali.
                <br />
                It bought groceries for Ms. Diya.
                <br />
                It mended a uniform for Mr. Hyder Ali's daughter.
                <br />
                It bought fresh vegetables for Mr. Satheeshan's family.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In the first scenario, ₹3000 delivered a dress. In the second,
                the same ₹3000 delivered a dress, security, education, and
                sustenance, binding the community together one transaction at a
                time. The local purchase isn't just a transaction; it's a
                commitment to the well-being of your neighbor.
