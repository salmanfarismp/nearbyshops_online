              <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">Part I: The Immediate Loss (The Online Purchase)</h4>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                When Sarah clicked "confirm order" on the massive online clothing site, she felt a small thrill. A new dress, arriving in two days. Total spent: $100.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                That $100 traveled instantly across the country, perhaps across an ocean, straight into the account of a colossal corporation. The money paid for warehouse automation, an executive salary far away, and global marketing. It was efficient, fast, and convenient.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                But that dollar, swift as it was, was gone from her town forever. It skipped her community entirely, leaving nothing behind but a box on her doorstep and a faint feeling of economic emptiness.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">Part II: The Continuous Ripple (The Local Purchase)</h4>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Now, imagine the alternative. Sarah walks down Main Street and buys the same dress from Ms. Evelyn's Fine Textiles. The cost is the same: $100.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">The First Ripple: Security</h4>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Ms. Evelyn takes that $100. It's not just a number; it's a certainty. That evening, she walks to The Daily Grocer and spends $40 of it, ensuring her family has fresh food for the week.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">The Second Ripple: Education</h4>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                The Grocer, Mr. Patel, now has Ms. Evelyn's $40. He was just worrying about his daughter's worn school clothes. He takes $15 and walks to Mr. Javid, the Local Tailor, to have her uniform mended and fit perfectly. Mr. Patel is proud his daughter will look sharp for school.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">The Third Ripple: Health & Sustenance</h4>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Mr. Javid, the Tailor, feels relieved. His own vegetable patch suffered in the last rain. He takes that $15 and immediately spends $8 at the farmers' market stall run by Old Man Thomas, buying crisp carrots and bell peppers. He thinks of his family's dinner.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">The Logical Conclusion</h4>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                The story doesn't end there. Old Man Thomas will spend his $8 on new seeds, buying them locally. That first $100 hasn't left the community; it has multiplied.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                It bought a dress for Sarah.
                <br />
                It bought groceries for Ms. Evelyn.
                <br />
                It mended a uniform for Mr. Patel's daughter.
                <br />
                It bought fresh vegetables for Mr. Javid's family.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In the first scenario, $100 delivered a dress. In the second, the same $100 delivered a dress, security, education, and sustenance, binding the community together one transaction at a time. The local purchase isn't just a transaction; it's a commitment to the well-being of your neighbor.
